            <h3>What is the Libertarian Party</h3>
            <p>The Libertarian Party (LP) is your representative in American politics. It is the only political organization which respects you as a unique and responsible individual.<p>
            <p>Our slogan is that we are “The Party of Principle”, because we stand firmly on our principles.</p>
            <p>Libertarians strongly oppose any government interference into their personal, family, and business decisions. Essentially, we believe all Americans should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1971, we run many hundred of candidates every election cycle. These candidates seek positions ranging from City Council to President of the United States. Each of these candidates helps to give liberty a voice.</p>

            <h3>The Libertarian Option</h3>
            <p>Consider voting Libertarian or joining the Libertarian Party because&hellip;</p>
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>We seek to substantially reduce the size and intrusiveness of government and cut and eliminate taxes at every opportunity.</li>
                <li>We believe that peaceful, honest people should be able to offer their goods and services to willing consumers without inappropriate interference from government.</li>
                <li>We believe that peaceful, honest people should decide for themselves how to live their lives, without fear of criminal or civil penalties.</li>
                <li>We believe that government’s only responsibility, if any, should be protecting people from force and fraud.</li>

            <p>
                We have two meetings a month: a social meeting and a meeting where we conduct party business.<br>
                The social meeting is usually held on the second Tuesday of the month at 6:30 PM.<br>
                The &quot;business&quot; meeting is held online, usually the next day at 7:00 PM.
            </p>
            <p>For more information on our upcoming meetings, see the below calendar events, see our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LPDuvalFL/">Meetup</a> page, or get in <a href="#contact-us-modal">contact</a> with us</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Join The Libertarian Party</h3>
            <p>The first and best step to getting involved is joining the Libertarian Party. Join our affiliate and the state affiliate for free. All we need from you is your name and email address.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we recommend you register as a Libertarian. Here's some information to do that. We'll give you the form... etc, etc.</p>

            <h3>Contribute</h3>
            <p>Unlike the <i>other two</i>, we are not funded by taxpayers. We have to raise all of the funds to run our organization, campaigns, and outreach programs ourselves. We need money to fight for your rights.</p>
            <p>We also accept in-kind donations such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Campaign yard signs; including their metal hangers</li>
                <li>Custom shirts, hats, etc. made for the party and/or candidates</li>
                <li>Cars, boats, houses, jewelry, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>
                Our party is completely run by volunteers. We would love for you to come help out. There's not enough time
                in a day to do everything we want and the best way to accomplish our goals is to divide and conquer. If
                you want to help out for an hour or an hour a day, we're very appreciative of <em>you</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every month we have a social meeting where we invite a speaker to come and talk about a topic. We need
                people that have a topic to talk about that would interest other Libertarians. It doesn't have to be
                specifically Libertarian related. Some of the ideas we have are: an accountant to talk about taxes;
                someone well versed in medical marijuana in Florida to talk about how one goes about getting their card;
                someone to talk about hurricane preparedness; any of our elected officials to come talk about what they and
                what they are doing for Libertarianism. Those are just examples. Suggestions are welcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                We plan on doing phone banking. We need people to call other Libertarians in their neighborhood. We need
                people that are willing to go to a busy place like a college campus and talk about the Libertarian Party.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's just some of the things we are looking for. If you have a skill or just a desire, <a href="#!">contact us</a>
                so we can talk about how you can help spread liberty in Duval County.
            </p>

            So glad you asked. We recognize that you're entrusting us to use your contributions to better the party and with that, the libertarian ideals that we're founded on.
            Although we have made every effort to reduce our operating costs to their bare minimum, there are some operating costs to running as website. That's part of it.
            We will use your contributions to purchase advertising on Facebook, Google, and other means.
            We want to be able to pool resources to purchase merchandise that Libertarians in Duval County can be proud of, such as t-shirts, polos, hats, pins, bumper stickers, etc.
